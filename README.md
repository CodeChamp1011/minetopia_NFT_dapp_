Make sure you have node.js installed so you can use npm, then run:

```sh
npm install

After installing node modules you can run.

```sh
npm run start
```

Or create the build if you are ready to deploy.

```sh
npm run build
```

Now you can host the contents of the build folder on a server.

That's it! you're done.
